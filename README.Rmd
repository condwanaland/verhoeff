# verhoeff

This package is just my take on implementing the Verhoeff algorithim for calculating check digits. This is not novel in R (i.e., see https://github.com/fascinatingfingers/CheckDigit), but was more a fun little project.

My influence for the algorithims implementation was primarily from the wikipedia outline (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm), and the paper by A. Dunn (Computer program for the calculation and validation of Verhoeff check digits, https://www.ccamlr.org/en/wg-fsa-sam-05/11)

Verhoeff is still undergoing most of its development. At this stage the package is not functional

## Installation

You can install verhoeff from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("condwanaland/verhoeff")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```
